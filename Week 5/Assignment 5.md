## Part 1: (10 points)  

Proove each of the following.  Indicate which proof method you are using and show your work.

 - [ ]  Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.
 - [ ]  If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
 - [ ]  The sum of two odd integers is even.  Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1	
 - [ ]  The sum of an even integer and it's square is even
 - [ ]  If n squared is odd, then n is odd

## Part 2: (10 points)
  
- [ ] Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)
- [ ] Prove that for any positive integer number n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3			
- [ ] Prove that for n >= 1, 9^n − 1 is divisible by 8 for all non-negative integers
		Hint: 4^(3+1) = 4 * 4^3
		Hint: If 9^n - 1 = 8m, then 9^n = 8m + 1
